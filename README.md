## About

This project showcases one of many implementations of [microservices](https://microservices.io/) in .NET 8. 
It also includes a variety of different tools and technologies such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage, 
[EntityFramework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) as the ORM, [Redis](https://redis.io/) as the caching solution, 
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) with [MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/) for the event based communication between microservices,
[Serilog](https://serilog.net/) for logging, [Moq](https://github.com/devlooped/moq) for unit testing and
[.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) to run the entire application.

**The main purpose of the project is to be used as a reference implementation in
case of need.**

These docs are work in progress :)
